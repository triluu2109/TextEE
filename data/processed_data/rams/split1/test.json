During the 2008 campaign , the Obama transition team distributed a memo to staff members on \u201c what qualifies as a promise . \u201d It explained , \u201c Words like \u2018 will , \u2019 \u2018 would , \u2019 \u2018 create , \u2019 \u2018 ensure , \u2019 \u2018 increase , \u2019 \u2018 eliminate \u2019 are good signals of specific policy commitments . \u201d When Trump talks about what he will create and what he will eliminate , he does n\u2019t depart from three core principles : in his view , America is doing too much to try to solve the world \u2019s problems ; trade agreements are damaging the country ; and immigrants are detrimental to it .", "tokens": ["\u201c", "Ding", "-", "dong", ".", "\u201d", "But", "campaigns", "offer", "a", "surprisingly", "accurate", "preview", "of", "Presidencies", ".", "In", "1984", ",", "the", "political", "scientist", "Michael", "Krukones", "tabulated", "the", "campaign", "pledges", "of", "all", "the", "Presidents", "from", "Woodrow", "Wilson", "to", "Jimmy", "Carter", "and", "found", "that", "they", "achieved", "seventy", "-", "three", "per", "cent", "of", "what", "they", "promised", ".", "Most", "recently", ",", "PolitiFact", ",", "a", "nonpartisan", "fact", "-", "checking", "site", ",", "has", "assessed", "more", "than", "five", "hundred", "promises", "made", "by", "Barack", "Obama", "during", "his", "campaigns", "and", "found", "that", ",", "to", "the", "irritation", "of", "his", "opponents", ",", "he", "has", "accomplished", "at", "least", "a", "compromised", "version", "of", "seventy", "per", "cent", "of", "them", ".", "To", "turn", "intentions", "into", "policy", ",", "previous", "transition", "teams", "have", "produced", "confidential", "guides", ",", "known", "as", "\u201c", "promise", "books", ",", "\u201d", "that", "pull", "from", "the", "candidate", "\u2019s", "words", "in", "order", "to", "shape", "the", "priorities", "of", "officials", "across", "the", "government", ".", "During", "the", "2008", "campaign", ",", "the", "Obama", "transition", "team", "distributed", "a", "memo", "to", "staff", "members", "on", "\u201c", "what", "qualifies", "as", "a", "promise", ".", "\u201d", "It", "explained", ",", "\u201c", "Words", "like", "\u2018", "will", ",", "\u2019", "\u2018", "would", ",", "\u2019", "\u2018", "create", ",", "\u2019", "\u2018", "ensure", ",", "\u2019", "\u2018", "increase", ",", "\u2019", "\u2018", "eliminate", "\u2019", "are", "good", "signals", "of", "specific", "policy", "commitments", ".", "\u201d", "When", "Trump", "talks", "about", "what", "he", "will", "create", "and", "what", "he", "will", "eliminate", ",", "he", "does", "n\u2019t", "depart", "from", "three", "core", "principles", ":", "in", "his", "view", ",", "America", "is", "doing", "too", "much", "to", "try", "to", "solve", "the", "world", "\u2019s", "problems", ";", "trade", "agreements", "are", "damaging", "the", "country", ";", "and", "immigrants", "are", "detrimental", "to", "it", "."], "event_mentions": [{"id": "nw_RC02a810b1c2b0e51529ea4d8360fdd7ea1f72d2247f43a27832eb568a_Evt0", "event_type": "contact.commitmentpromiseexpressintent.correspondence", "trigger": {"text": "promises", "start": 71, "end": 72}, "arguments": [{"entity_id": "nw_RC02a810b1c2b0e51529ea4d8360fdd7ea1f72d2247f43a27832eb568a_Ent0", "role": "communicator", "text": "Barack Obama", "start": 74, "end": 76}]}], "entity_mentions": [{"id": "nw_RC02a810b1c2b0e51529ea4d8360fdd7ea1f72d2247f43a27832eb568a_Ent0", "text": "Barack Obama", "entity_type": "Entity", "start": 74, "end": 76}], "lang": "en"}

The two men said authorities are covering up the deaths by reporting the men as missing , or having their records say they died elsewhere . Dmitry , who is now back in Moscow and says he 's one of about 50 former Wagner troops in the city , gave up his personal identification when he signed up to serve .", "tokens": ["The", "company", "allegedly", "recruits", "men", "online", "through", "military", "-", "themed", "chatrooms", ".", "In", "a", "record", "of", "one", "such", "conversation", "obtained", "by", "Sky", "News", ",", "a", "man", "reaches", "out", "to", "Wagner", "and", "answers", "a", "few", "basic", "questions", "about", "his", "physical", "fitness", "and", "any", "potential", "legal", "issues", "before", "being", "asked", "to", "\"", "come", "to", "Molkino", ",", "\"", "a", "small", "town", "that", "'s", "home", "to", "a", "special", "forces", "base", ".", "According", "to", "Alexander", ",", "Wagner", "is", "n't", "highly", "selective", "when", "it", "comes", "to", "recruits", ",", "but", "the", "training", ",", "which", "lasts", "for", "a", "month", "or", "two", ",", "is", "intense", ",", "and", "how", "the", "men", "end", "up", "serving", "depends", "on", "their", "level", "of", "military", "experience", ".", "The", "two", "men", "said", "authorities", "are", "covering", "up", "the", "deaths", "by", "reporting", "the", "men", "as", "missing", ",", "or", "having", "their", "records", "say", "they", "died", "elsewhere", ".", "Dmitry", ",", "who", "is", "now", "back", "in", "Moscow", "and", "says", "he", "'s", "one", "of", "about", "50", "former", "Wagner", "troops", "in", "the", "city", ",", "gave", "up", "his", "personal", "identification", "when", "he", "signed", "up", "to", "serve", "."], "event_mentions": [{"id": "nw_RC0510266ed701ad0564b1556696777d9f985c590000d63facb33319f5_Evt0", "event_type": "personnel.startposition.hiring", "trigger": {"text": "recruits", "start": 80, "end": 81}, "arguments": [{"entity_id": "nw_RC0510266ed701ad0564b1556696777d9f985c590000d63facb33319f5_Ent0", "role": "place", "text": "a special forces base", "start": 62, "end": 66}, {"entity_id": "nw_RC0510266ed701ad0564b1556696777d9f985c590000d63facb33319f5_Ent2", "role": "placeofemployment", "text": "Wagner", "start": 71, "end": 72}, {"entity_id": "nw_RC0510266ed701ad0564b1556696777d9f985c590000d63facb33319f5_Ent1", "role": "employee", "text": "men", "start": 100, "end": 101}]}], "entity_mentions": [{"id": "nw_RC0510266ed701ad0564b1556696777d9f985c590000d63facb33319f5_Ent0", "text": "a special forces base", "entity_type": "Entity", "start": 62, "end": 66}, {"id": "nw_RC0510266ed701ad0564b1556696777d9f985c590000d63facb33319f5_Ent2", "text": "Wagner", "entity_type": "Entity", "start": 71, "end": 72}, {"id": "nw_RC0510266ed701ad0564b1556696777d9f985c590000d63facb33319f5_Ent1", "text": "men", "entity_type": "Entity", "start": 100, "end": 101}], "lang": "en"}

Fabrice Arfi , a French investigative journalist at Mediapart who helped uncover the alleged links between Qaddafi and Sarkozy , is skeptical that the the Blumenthal memo captures France 's true motivations for war in Libya . \" At first glance , this hypothesis [ that France 's intervention was motivated by Gaddafi 's plans for a Pan - African currency ] seems far - fetched , \" he told VICE News by phone .", "tokens": ["Sarkozy", "'s", "relationship", "with", "Gaddafi", "took", "another", "odd", "turn", "when", "allegations", "surfaced", "that", "the", "Libyan", "leader", "had", "helped", "fund", "the", "president", "'s", "2007", "electoral", "campaign", ".", "In", "2012", ",", "French", "investigative", "news", "site", "Mediapart", "published", "an", "official", "document", "dating", "back", "to", "2006", "detailing", "plans", "for", "the", "dictator", "to", "bankroll", "Sarkozy", "'s", "campaign", "to", "the", "tune", "of", "50", "million", "euros", ".", "The", "document", "\u2014", "which", "was", "disputed", "by", "Sarkozy", "\u2014", "surfaced", "among", "the", "archives", "of", "the", "demolished", "Qaddafi", "regime", ",", "and", "has", "been", "backed", "up", "by", "several", "former", "regime", "insiders", ".", "Fabrice", "Arfi", ",", "a", "French", "investigative", "journalist", "at", "Mediapart", "who", "helped", "uncover", "the", "alleged", "links", "between", "Qaddafi", "and", "Sarkozy", ",", "is", "skeptical", "that", "the", "the", "Blumenthal", "memo", "captures", "France", "'s", "true", "motivations", "for", "war", "in", "Libya", ".", "\"", "At", "first", "glance", ",", "this", "hypothesis", "[", "that", "France", "'s", "intervention", "was", "motivated", "by", "Gaddafi", "'s", "plans", "for", "a", "Pan", "-", "African", "currency", "]", "seems", "far", "-", "fetched", ",", "\"", "he", "told", "VICE", "News", "by", "phone", "."], "event_mentions": [{"id": "nw_RCfed8417a729c392c93e5cb3897b1337cd2558ad59f631022fbbbca2c_Evt0", "event_type": "artifactexistence.damagedestroy.destroy", "trigger": {"text": "demolished", "start": 75, "end": 76}, "arguments": [{"entity_id": "nw_RCfed8417a729c392c93e5cb3897b1337cd2558ad59f631022fbbbca2c_Ent0", "role": "artifact", "text": "Qaddafi regime", "start": 76, "end": 78}]}], "entity_mentions": [{"id": "nw_RCfed8417a729c392c93e5cb3897b1337cd2558ad59f631022fbbbca2c_Ent0", "text": "Qaddafi regime", "entity_type": "Entity", "start": 76, "end": 78}], "lang": "en"}
